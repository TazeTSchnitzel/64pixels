I am not going to do any kind of legalese here, neither am I going to use an existing license. Let's keep it short.

1. Do anything you morally would do, as long as:
	a) you give credit to the original author of the software,
	b) you agree that your changes may be integrated into the official release of the software (with the original author of the software giving you credit) unless you specifically mention that you do not want the changes to be integrated,
	c) you release source code of your modifications to the software.

2. If you break any of the rules, you're on Santa's "naughty" list. And I won't like you.

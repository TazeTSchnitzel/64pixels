Changes for 0.1.x so far:
- a 2-pulse for pensors
- synchronized 2-pulses and not minimum-of-4 pulses for plates
- re-merge CraftrVersion
- make floor param be pushium param
- one-byte move deltas

TODO:

TO DO IF I FEEL LIKE IT:
- player flags

archoverhaul response:

BLOCKS
--------
Wirium: no changes, I guess
P-NAND: the same
Crossuh: I'm keeping my old version and also made it always output maxcharge (15) (in 0.0.x somewhere) because according to Salzkorn it got confusing without that. No changes.
Plate: Added the even-pulse thing
Door: No changes?
Pensor: Here, now it does a 2-pulse.
Pushium: Nice idea, but I don't want to add more flags. I AM adding "pushable layer param" (former floor param), though.

PROTOCOL
---------
Password algorithm: Nice idea!

16-bit player/block IDs: Nope. Nada. I know it's useful for Smalltalk but it's the client/server which will internally keep the IDs of each block, not common code. And 255 players on a server is enough.
Players are using id 255 for their own messages. (C->S)
Server is using id 255 for its own messages. (S->C)
I am considering giving Smalltalk objects id 254 in (S->C).

One-byte move delta: Nice idea! Will save a tiny bit of bandwidth and all

Player flags: I'm TOTALLY adding this. TOTALLY. (if i feel like it)

65536-byte chunk data packets: The maximum size is around 1000/packet (TCP limitations?)

kick_player(plr, "Dude, you lag too much, you must live in New Zealand"); <- correct that to "you must be Demki". He lags on virtually EVERY server in existence, except his own and... my home server!? :o

@GM: The rest is probably not coming, or at least not yet. Maybe in 0.2.x...

64pixels source code

Read the LICENSE file before publishing your forks, please. (i should change it)
Some tips:

1. use compile.sh to compile source files from craftr/ and craftr-srvr/ or else!!! (common/ doesnt need it)
	^ note: this will need to be updated to point to client/server or something like that --GM
2. use make_jars.sh to make the JARs (all of them)

notes from GM:
	code merge has been done. stuff is in client/common/server.
	stuff in craftr/craftr-srvr is old and will not be updated so don't use them.
	also some bugs were fixed.
	
	the architecture is still a bit messed up, and will still need some improvement,
	but stuff shouldn't need to be copy-pasted between two almost-identical files now.
	
	the *Shim files are used as interfaces.
	unfortunately, CraftrServer or something still uses public variables,
	so I've had to use an abstract class instead.
	having said that, i deleted CraftrSoundShim as all the sound interfacing is in the client.
	
	one more thing.
	asiekierka, i basically ignored your common/ updates.
	feel free to shove any specifics back in.
